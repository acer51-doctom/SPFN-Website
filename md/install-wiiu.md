## Installation - Wii U

---

Requirements:
- Wii U with Aroma
- SD Card (Preferrably 32GB)
- Computer or other device to access SD Card
- An internet connection

Ensure that you don't have a default user set before setting up SPFN as it could cause you to log in with the wrong account. To disable it, turn on your Wii U and when it logs in, press your Mii in the top left and scroll down to the option labelled "Default User" and disable it.

If you are currently using Pretendo's DNS servers to connect to Pretendo, disable the DNS server before continuing.

### Step 1: SD Card Preparation

Plug your SD card into your computer and navigate to `SD:/wiiu/environments`

Make a copy of your `aroma` environment folder and rename it to `SPFN` - this will be the environment you use for connecting to our servers.

For users who previously used Pretendo's Inkay plugin, delete the files `plugins/inkay-pretendo.wps` and `modules/inkay-pretendo.wms` from the SPFN environment.

Download the plugins and modules found here (LINK NOT AVAILABLE) - make sure you enable file name extensions in your file browser and take note of the extension.

- `plugin.wps` goes into `plugins`
- `module.wms` goes into `modules`

With these files installed, you can eject your SD card and put it into your Wii U.

### Step 2: Setup on Console

Power on the console and hold `X` on the gamepad to open the Environment Loader.

Navigate using the D-Pad to `SPFN` and press `A` to select. Your console will now load into the environment and connect to our servers.

In the top left of your screen, you should see a message saying "Connected to Servers".

> If you see "Using Pretendo Network", DO NOT PROGRESS. Turn off the console and delete the Pretendo plugins as mentioned in step 1.

> If you do not see the "Connected to Servers" message, you likely didn't install the plugin correctly. Check the locations of the `plugin.wps` and `module.wms` files.

SPFN's servers are separate from both Nintendo and Pretendo, so you will need to create a new account to access our services. Now that your console is connected to our servers, you should be brought to the accounts page Press `+` on your gamepad to create a new account. Follow the process of creating the account. Select no when prompted if you have an NNID. Select a Mii for your account. When asked to create an account, press Link.

Before continuing, confirm that the agreement references Splatfestival Network. If it does not, your plugins aren't set up correctly. Return to step 1 and ensure they are correctly placed.

If it does reference Splatfestival Network, read through the agreement and press `Agree`, then enter your account information.

> DO NOT REUSE PASSWORDS ACROSS MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS INSIDE OR OUTSIDE OF OUR NETWORK

Once you have created your account, you will be sent a verification code to your registered email address. To enter it, log into your account on your Wii U and it will prompt you for the code. If you are already logged in, press on your Mii in the top left of your gamepad and select Switch User. Then, select your SPFN account to log back in.

Open Splatoon and check that you get the news.
